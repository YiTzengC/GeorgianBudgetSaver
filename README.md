Purpose:
  I will make a web application for students who study in Georgian College to sell their used
textbooks. It is important how to save money when studying because we will need to buy course
material for some courses. Not every student has access to new book, so they can buy used books to
control their budget. In the app, I will organize books by programs so that people can easily and
efficiently look for their items.
